I use C++ to finish the assignment.
These are the libary I use in the assignment.

#include "program assignment1.h"
#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>
#include <math.h>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

I directly read the file "input.txt" in my cpp file "program assignment1.cpp".
If you want to test another case, please modify the source code to change the input file. 

It's in the 63rd row "  ifstream fin("please put the file you want to test.txt");  " .
